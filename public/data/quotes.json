Try to think what have you got. Can you measure it with your understanding? No, you cannot – because rationality cannot give you the dimensions into which you have fallen now. The rationality is actually broken up. There is no rationality left now any more to even communicate as to what you have been seeking and where you have landed. So the only method you have got now, or only way is left to you, for a drop which has become an ocean, is to dissolve more in the ocean, so that you feel the ocean at least. And to communicate with other drops in such a way that you know the whole through time.",

But you do not take it for granted. You are harming yourself by accepting that forgiveness, if you think all the time, 'Oh Mother, you are so forgiving, please forgive me'. You are already forgiven as it is. Once you call me Mother I have forgiven. But what's the advantage out of it. You are a loser.

And all the drops dropping their 'drop-ness' become the ocean ultimately. So we see that Devotion is double edged. One is to each other, and one is to your Mother. In Sahaja Yoga, whatever I see, you cannot see. This is proved or not to you people? Or do you want more proofs? Now it is proved that Mother sees much beyond us, and whatever she sees happens. So anyone who tries to play tricks with Mother is actually playing tricks with himself.

He also forgives our attachments, our superficialities, jealousies, lust, anger, petty jealousies, vanities and also our possessiveness. He forgives our egoistical behaviour and our subordination to wrong things. But when He forgives, He thinks he has given you a big grace-mark, and that reaction builds up within him as a wrath against those who are forgiven and try to do greater mistakes. Especially after realisation, because such a big blessing is there; you have got the light and in the light if you are holding on to your plate, then His wrath goes up because He sees how stupid you have been. What I am saying is that after realisation especially He is much more sensitive to people who are forgiven and have been given such a big thing like realisation, still they do wrong things, the He is much more wrathful.

Either you should have very strong sensitivity or you should understand what is Sahaja Yoga. A person who is still negative always gets attracted towards another one who is very powerfully negative and does not understand that the other person is so powerfully negative, whether he is mad, there is something wrong with him, he is your relation or anything. No sympathy of any kind, on the contrary, a kind of anger should be there for that person, a kind of detachment. And this angry detachment is the only time when you have to be angry. But I have seen people who have anger for very good Sahaja Yogis but not for their own husbands and wives who are extremely negative.",

All your dignity, your authority comes from Him. 3) And the third thing is that the way He has created this universe and you, in a mood of play, you have to see His play.

I mean to say that our being is created by five elements, and the five elements have a capacity all the time to get destroyed. Any one of these elements, if they are not looked after, gets destroyed. That is the built in capacity of the elements or of the matter as you can say. So to maintain them is important. So people have an idea that once you become a Guru you need not maintain anything, it is maintained by itself. It is not. Agreed that the Spirit definitely enhances the beauty and health of this element, but at the human level there is always a greater force trying to destroy it.

Some doctors had given a very good report saying that 'if the body is vulnerable for cancer,' – according to Sahaja Yoga when you have too much in a sympathetic activity, then you are vulnerable for cancer – 'then an attack comes to you from the area which is built from our creation'. They are very near. They call it Protein 58, but what are these things that trigger it? Because of the jumble of the four collective consciousnesses they thought we have to god down. But there is a clear path in the middle centre.",

It was so great and courageous of Jung to talk about this when Freud was so much accepted by everyone. Even now in London there are only twelve Jungians, you'll be surprised. I'm so happy to see so many of you here. So he is the one who very courageously put forward this idea that there is the Mother's force within us which is a fact. And which can be proved if you see historically how at the time of Moses and Abraham, you see Moses crossing the bridge. You see this is significant here. This is the Void. We call it the Void, but Zen, for them the Void is different. So we cross this. In the same way Moses crossed, through the bridging he did it. And this bridging takes place when the Kundalini rises from that triangular bone and crosses over, then the first bridging takes place. Supposing somebody who knows about the whole framework can tell you about everything, that is what is needed today. Historically it was, I would say, the Dharma, the religion was established historically for our consciousness. Everybody has contributed.",

The left side people who are sly, who invade, who torture, the masochist people; the right side as the sadist people, when they do not leave their habits and then they possess people. Hitler trained with the Lamas how to use the supraconscious spirits to impress, or possess, the Germans, and he managed that very well. Because of that they lost their consciousness, they didn't know what they were doing, and that's how these people did things even animals would not do. Without any sense of shame, decency, love or compassion and, surprisingly, they called it the Fatherland.

So fourteen thousand years back, you'll be surprised, there was a great seer called Markandeya who has written all about the ascent of the Kundalini and everything. There was a great astrologer in India about sixteen or seventeen hundred years back, He wrote one great book called Bhrigu Samhita, but before that he wrote another one called Nadi Grantha on lotus leaves. This voluminous thing was later completely brought up to date level by another person about three hundred years back whose name was Bhujander – can you imagine that this man thousands of years back predicted clearly that the Sahaja Yoga will start in 1970 and that in that way the Kundalini will rise spontaneously and people will get their realisation?",

Sometimes I mean I get really frustrated with Sahaja Yogis, very much. Then I just before the mirror and I say, 'Now, come along. You are the one who has all the powers, who has all the chakras awakened. None of the Advents had this. You are the one who has created this world and you are the one who has to save it! So now, get up!' Not to lose courage. Not to worry. Only in the emotional things I sometimes feel that now I'll have to give up some of them, completely. They are my children, as a mother, not as a Guru - for a Guru they don't have problem - and then the stirring up comes in within myself that, 'No, even if I have to give up, doesn't matter, I have to raise, absolutely', and with that power it works. so the reflection should be of Me, of something that is ideal before you; the one that gives you energy – like this song- and not the reflection of a miserable person. Christ standing before you as in the Sistine Chapel, and not some miserable skeleton, which is even worse than you. So create those images of your Mother which you should see in your emotions, and rise. This is the second type of attention which you have to control.",

So that kind of an attention you have, then you better keep quiet. Don't talk. Just listen to others what they talk. There are some people who will just go on talking, talking, talking – irrelevantly, uselessly, wasting their energy, and such people are always friend of the cunning. They go hand in hand because the cunning wants to befool someone, and the fool wants to be befooled. Like a king will have a jester, that's how these combinations work out. So for such people the best thing is to keep quiet, preserve all their attention, all their energies, for cleansing. All this idiocy will pass away very soon if you try to preserve yourself. Don't talk. Don't say things which are stupid, idiotic. Just keep quiet and watch others.

Very parched and they cannot enjoy life. There's no mobility. They cannot be creative, only as far as their style is concerned, but not the creative of the joy. Extremely concentrated fanatics.

It is a very great task to build up these divine mechanisms in different parts of your country. For example Mother Earth has done Her job.

Void has got 10 destructive powers also. Out of those 10, the destructive part settles down here so when a person is on his destruction, say, for example, cancer has set in, then you might feel a throb here at the apex of your void. It doesn't mean that if there's a throb, there's a cancer, but if there's a cancer, there'll be a throb in here going on. That means the force of life is trying to push it, but the obstruction there starts accumulation on both sides, and in the centre is the centre of the Vishuddhi, of the Virata. Shri Krishna has become the Virata, the Great Primordial Being, so this is the 11th power of destruction. He has the power called Samhara Shakti by which he kills people. So, before killing them and finishing them off, in the compassion of your Mother, we have to first try to transform them. If they cannot be transformed then it's alright, then let Ekadasha take over.

Secondly, if a person comes to know about any destructive diseases, like cancer, he want to find out a method, and there is not method available on a human level, so then he thinks of God and wants to come nearer to God. The fear brings him closer to God. He depends on God more than on his rationality, ego or superego, and he wants to depend on God's powers to cure him or same him from this destruction, because he is now on the brink of destruction, as soon as cancer sets in, he know that there's no end to it and he has to be destroyed. So, this is another way people take to transformation, change their attitudes, change their value systems, develop a new kind of personality which was never apparent before. So, all harshness drops out, and all the sweetness starts pouring in. So the compassion in a man is awakened, by which he gets transformed. Many people who lost their kith and kin become much more gentle, kinder, because Ekadasha has expressed its awe, and fear that tomorrow this can happen to me also, so I must do something about it.

When you have your ego, very much great ego, then you'll find a big blob like ego coming out on the left side, a very big one here.

Now when you see a flower becomes the fruit, everything practically drops out of the flower, we can say. Like the calyx is dropped out, then the petals are dropped out and then the epicalyx is also dropped out, but what remains is the seed actually, if you see. Around the seed all these things developed and the fruit remains, the rest of it drops out. So in us also, whatever becomes the Spirit remains, the rest drops out, and that is what it is when we call it the Ekadasha which brings forth the transformation, and one has to understand – we have to drop out many things.",

Now, it goes a very long way, the vibrations are still there, but suddenly they stop and you find you're out of bounds. You're thrown out completely, but you do not feel how you're thrown out. Gradually you find, like a tangent you go out, and so one has to be careful about it. So within us lies a force which is centrifugal, and a force which is centripetal. So, Ekadasha's force is centrifugal, by which you are thrown out. Sahaja Yoga doesn't fall onto anyone's feet, doesn't flatter anyone, doesn't request anyone. If you want to be there, you have to be positively there and if you don't want to be there, it throws you much faster than you want. That is the trouble with Sahaja Yoga and this is the loophole which I have to tell you as a Mother – that it's very anxious to throw you out.",

In the same way, if you have the romance already done, what's the marriage? What's the celebration for? It's absolutely illogical. There is no romance in such cases. Actually, you've seen that after the romance, the marriage, and then the divorce. It's always like that because you become stale, and you find that the romance you had before the marriage was something, a fantastic fantasy that has dropped out and now, after marriage, there is nothing left to enjoy, so you are fed up, and next month you are now in the divorce court.",

Naturally, because you don't know where will be the mother tomorrow, where will be the father. Now we are to blame for the high rate of fertility, but what to do? Children don't listen, they don't want to go to such places where there's no stability for them to exist, specially the realised children if they are of a very high quality. (They do .. I mean, they have to be like devils to get into this thing, so they may try, or maybe real devils take advantage of it).

I said, alright, I don't say anything, but you'll have such diseases that you'll have to come back. That was the time they passed the law that homosexuality should be allowed, permissiveness should be allowed and all these things – and now you have AIDs, now here already operating. Now AIDs has given the fear of Ekadasha. Now have it! What's wrong? What about that. So this awe and fear is very important.

We have to remember that we are part and parcel of that God, and that we have to awaken ourselves to the consciousness that He is the Whole and we have to become one with the Whole.

It is He who stands in the middle between the Maya of the Adi Shakti and the pure witness of the Paramatma Shri Shiva Sadashiva – neither one, or the other, connecting them both.

This drama is born of Divine Will and Desire and therefore that is opposed. In the West, one has an idea that Grihastha and marriage are given to us to enjoy, and it is true that this is the outer manifestation, but there is a deeper, hidden meaning, that by it we fulfil our duty to God who has manifested as the Virata so that, in spite of being one with the Atma, we accept the responsibility of matter, to be one with Him and prove our Love and Bhakti for Him.

If we are not prepared to face the world, we go against the Vishnu Tattwa, and his Shakti Sri Lakshmi forsakes us. Further, we deny the fact of our birth and material existence in this world gained through the grace and auspices of Lord Vishnu supported by Lord Ganesha. If we do not accept our responsibility to maintain our Lakshmi, it will be hard for Sahaja Yoga to penetrate the material universe, for who will build the Ashrams and hold the programmes? Often in Sahaja Yoga one is asked to pay for this and that and people grumble, but they see only the gross drama, not the deep subtle meaning: that one is being asked to pay attention to the Lakshmi Vishnu Tattwa so that the Virata can be enlightened by the enlightened Atmas we all possess by Mother's grace.

This is the first stage where you jump into the superconscious. Your first is Nirvichar – thoughtless, you become thoughtlessly aware. That happens when the Kundalini rises above the Agnya chakra; meaning enters into the limbic area when our attention just touches Sat point. The reality separates from Mithya, illusion. At that stage you start separating, like putting lime in the milk when it starts separating into curd and water. You can cure people with your Kundalini in the limbic area.

Thus you start feeling the Chitta of your Chit becoming the Chitta of collective consciousness. That means you can feel another person's Kundalini. The ego and superego are still there, but your attention has come up and you feel the Chitta.

Such a person is not tempted by any woman. The stomach becomes the Dharma itself, Mooladhara becomes the chastity itself. When you get into the Nirvikalpa state, the Anand starts settling in you, your consciousness become Anand. There is Chaitanya all around which thinks, which understands, organises and loves us.

The first five on the left-hand side come from … if you have bowed yourself to wrong gurus, or if you have read wrong books, or if you have been in the company of wrong people, or if you have been sympathetic to people who have been following wrong paths, or you have been yourself one of the agents or guru of these wrong people. Now these five problems can be solved, if we completely give up whatever wrong we have been doing. As Mohammad Sahib has said that you have to beat the Shaitan, means the Satan, with shoes, but that has to be done, not mechanically, but from your heart. People who get involved with their family and try to take them out from those gurus… also get entangled, or some of them yield to others' forces.",

And some mediocre and half-baked Sahaja Yogis may try to understand, but will know that 'this fellow is going out, now he is on his way out'. So all these things: destructive and negative forces, yielding to family pressure, lead to this left side development, or we can call it on the head … on the right hand side of your Medha.

We have known some people who give big lectures in any programmes and never allow tape to be played or anything. They think they have now become experts. Then some of them say that now we have become so great that we need not do any foot-soaking or anything, there is not need to do meditation, there are some like that also, and then there are some who say that sin can never touch us now we are Sahaja Yogis, we are very great evolved souls. But the worst of all are those who just take my name, saying that, 'Mother has said so and so and I am telling you because Mother has said', when I have never said such a thing; it is all falsehood. Now there are some people who use Sahaja money and exploit Sahaja Yogis in such a way, exploit them also sometimes, and such people become very inauspicious. Anyone who tries such things will go out of Sahaja Yoga in disgrace, but one should never go near such a person, have nothing to do with such a person, have no sympathies, because this inauspiciousness will hurt anyone to any extent, so better keep of such persons. When these 10 Ekadashas develop within a person such a person can develop diseases like cancer and incurable, dirty diseases, especially if they combine with Agnya.

And it is for all kinds of false religious sects and false gurus and false religions which are followed in the name of God, or, any religion that does not say about self realisation and does not achieve self realisation and does not get connected with God … is false. So, any such thing that is just faith and talks of God but has no connection with God cannot be a true religion. Of course it gives balance to people, but in giving that balance if people live on that money and try to enjoy a wealth out of that money, then it is not even at the lowest level of religion. Like a balance, you see, religion has to give a balance to begin with, but in that balancing, when they tell 'you have to be balanced, but give me money for that, you must give me money, give me all your purse, give me everything', then that cannot be balanced, it does not even have the slightest thing or the blessings of God. Or any religion that makes you bow to anybody else but an incarnation is not a religion, that is another one which is absolutely false. The real religion will give you a balance and will always talk about the ascent, but they will not ask for money or make one something great as venerated. Discriminate through your vibrations.",

They were about to bang into that, they closed their eyes and, God knows what happened, they opened their eyes and saw the truck was going forward and upward and they were moving forward and downwards without any difficulties. And they were amazed how it has happened, as if somebody has lifted their car and put it before the truck, and they have been saved. And the driver closed his eyes and took the name of Mother. It is possible! It has happened so many times, with so many people that they do not know how it works out.

So, when you look at things, say this is a wall; a wall is a wall, that's all, what is there to think about? But a person who is not a realised soul will immediately start thinking about a wall even. Now, when he said, 'Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes' – of course, the adultery as we understand it, is that we should not have lust in our eyes – but I would go still further to say that our attention has to be so pure that we should not have any idea of return coming to us from a particular things, but just enjoying it, just the joy part of it. If I see a beautiful thing, then I am just enjoying it, not that I should possess it, nor should I think about it, nor do I need to repeat it. Just enjoy it as it is.

Not only that, but the whole store of knowledge is wide open before you. If so, someone may ask, what is the necessity for a school? I will give an example. A person may have no knowledge of painting. He can, even then, tell you the different colours or the colour combination in the painting, but, unless you have the special skill, you cannot produce the different combinations and give form to the painting. You may call it the technique. Unless you know the technique you cannot give proper shape to your work. Without the technique it remains without any shape.

The fact, to become the brain, has to evolve, i.e. to achieve certain amount of changes of human awareness. Human brain has a dimension, which animals do not have, a mental or emotional dimension, with which we understand love. We understand how to receive and how to reciprocate. We understand beauty and poetry; and we also understand how to create these. Brain is triangular and prismatic in nature. When the rays of God's Divine power flow in, they get refracted into different angles, and by the principle of a parallelogram of forces, a part of the power escapes to left side and a part to right side.

God protects you out and out and He looks after you with complete attention and care, and He is so loving that description of His compassion cannot be given in words, but can be only felt and understood.But after realisation, those people who are of great valour and strength ascend so fast that all the problems of the stars, your Nakashatras (Birth-stars), constellations, everything, disappears and you become a Sahaja Yogi, means newly born, absolutely a different personality. It has nothing to do from where you have come, like an egg becoming a beautiful bird.",

    "Quote": "So, the Kundalini when it arrived here, the first hurdle the Kundalini has to enter the Sahasrara is 'Ekadasha Rudra'. These are 11 Shaktis, 11 destroying Shaktis, placed here: five on this side, five on the other side and one in the centre. These are obstructions within us, built by two types of sin we commit. If we bow our heads to wrong type of gurus and submit ourselves to the vicious ways, then we develop Rudra problems on the right-hand side, these five go out (left). If you have bowed down – because I've never bowed to anybody wrong – to someone who is a wrong type of person and who is anti-God, then the problems comes on this side of the thing, on the right side. If you have the sense that, 'I can look after myself, I am my own guru, who can teach me, I don't want to listen to anybody and I don't believe in God, who is God, I just don't care for God' – all such feelings, then your right side doesn't catch, but your left side catches. Because right side moves this side and the left this side. So, these 10 things and one is Virata Vishnu, because also in the stomach we have got 10 Guru Sthanas (places), and one that is of Vishnu. So, the seeking is also wrong, as well as these 10 Gurus are out. Then you develop the Ekadasha Rudra.",

So, one of the greatest hurdles of Kundalini entering into Sahasrara is this Ekadasha-Rudra, which comes from the Void and which covers the Medha (is the plate of the brain), and that is how it cannot enter into the limbic area. Even those who have been to wrong gurus, if they have reached the right conclusion and surrendered themselves to Sahaja Yoga, accepting their mistakes and saying that, 'I am my own Guru', they can be cured. And those who have been speaking that, 'I am above all, I don't believe in God. Who is God? I don't believe in any prophets or anything' – anything against God or the prophets is the same – anti-God person talks like that develops the problems, gets alright if he humbles down himself and accepts Sahaja Yoga as the only way of entering into superconsciousness. I've seen Tantrikas and people who have done all kinds of wrong things be saved.

I never misunderstand, there is no question. Or some people try to tell me, 'do this, do that', that also is not necessary.

We can say that this attention that's coming in, goes into a parallelogram of forces because we have two types of densities in our brain. There is also refraction and, because of this refraction, this parallelogram of forces acts in such a way that your attention goes out, reacts, and, when it reacts, thought waves start coming in to us. You must have seen a lake. If you drop a stone in a lake, the waves start and they come to the shores of the lake and then it is the shore that gives it another wave that goes back. In the same way, when human beings look at anything, they put attention to it; there is always a reaction that comes to you.",

It's not true; it's a myth, because thinking is just an empty process of the mind. It's like a wave passing towards the shore and thinks that it can just engulf it – or dissolve it completely. So the thought is just an empty vessel which carries nothing. It cannot do anything; it cannot bring forth any fruit whatsoever. Sometimes this statement might look very big and you might think, 'how can that be, Mother? We've done so much by thinking, and this and that.' But, you've not!

If you have not known an ordinary aeroplane, how are you going to build a complicated one? So, first know that whatever is achieved is Self-realisation and the cleansing power of Shri Ganesha.

The whole preparation has been made for this Aquarian age to come in to bring the Kundalini upward and to make the whole thing work out in such a way that the left and aright meet and you all become ignited, enlightened. It was a question of our being, sharing the whole job in a proper understanding. Now see how Mother Earth herself was created. It is a very simple thing. First the movement of the energy started flowing. Now, this is a combined energy, all right? Then, the combined energy went round and round like that, and when it consolidated there was a big bang took place – now this is manly work, I should say, manly style, because still the Mother Earth is not produced, so then these little fragments again went round and round. With the momentum they became roundish. Out of them Mother Earth was selected for one job. On the Mother Earth, out of water, came the life – the carbon came in. Everybody helped there and a human being was created. Then the men went round, to improve their societies and whatever was possible with their ego is done, finished, now they have done their job. Now they are on the dole. Women have to complete their part and go forward together",

At that time, the Kundalini has to rise and ignite in such a way that the completion of the whole world takes place – it is simple. Do you understand now? So, there's no competition between men and women, but the style of work is different. If you understand that, then only this kind of revolution will take place and not turn out a rebellion. Actually women are rebelling against men, and a nonsense it is. It is such a headache, that you create something, allow them to grow, and another party comes, which has to complete the job, starts rebelling. So the revolution has to take place and the revolution is only possible when we understand that what part is left out is now to be done. Are you getting me all right?",

You see, women are told that, 'you are good for nothing', so now they are trying to show, 'No, we are also all right. If you have eaten one crow, we will eat three'. Now this understanding and the wise perception would be such that, 'What do we have to do now to change the mode and the style of our lives? What's wrong here?' A turning point has come. Now the evolution is not rebellion at all by any chance. It's a wrong idea people have. It's not that you hit me and I hit you – go on hitting each other, like the movement of the pendulum. It's not like a boom, that today you are born as a Muslim, tomorrow you are born as a Jew, then you are born as a Hindu – it's not a pendulum. It's a spiral movement.

They dress up as women, but that's not the way, from inside, from the heart, a feminine heart. Christ showed that in His life, He forgave. Only a woman can forgive, man cannot because he is aggressive. How can he forgive? Krishna never forgave anyone. He used to kill right royal fashion, so all right, if you are all right, done. Christ forgave to such an extent to show that he is now giving a turn to the spiral, and now a feminine quality has to be developed among human beings. But that doesn't mean that you start walking like a woman or developing waistlines, because that's another stupidity, but to be Motherly, not to be fatherly, but to be Motherly, that kindness, that gentleness should be in your behaviour towards each other.",

So just now one has to accept that to be like Mother Earth they have to be forbearing – Dhara. She is the sustenance of everything, She takes everything, the vibrations are sucked in. And now, for the first time, after realisation, you can give Her back what you have got from Her. You can give vibrations to Her trees that are created, you can make them beautiful. You can transform a flower into a more beautiful flower. Now, whatever you have to give, what you have got from Mother Earth, you can give because your Mother Earth is awakened in you now. So you return Her back everything that you got from Her, and give it to others: generosity, the greatness of heart, nobility, forgiveness, love, affection, bearing everything for love. And for the Mother to save her child she'll starve herself, do everything to save her child, complete dedication she has for her child.

That we should achieve something really great this time. Now as time is short, I will tell you first of all a few things about meditation now. Meditation is a very general word. It is not a word that explains all the three steps one has to take for meditating, but in Sanskrit language they have very clearly said how you have to move in your meditation. First is called as Dhyana, and second is called as Dharana, and the third is called as Samadhi. Luckily Sahaja Yoga is such a thing that you get everything in a bundle. You avoided everything else and you got the Samadhi part, that's the beauty of it.",

And the Dharana is the one in which you put all your effort, but this is all drama for people who are not realised. For them it's just a sort of acting that they do. But for a realised soul it's a reality. So the first, the Dhyana, you have to do. Some do it of the form, another of the formless, but you are so fortunate that the formless has become a form for you, no problem, you don't have to go from form to formless, from formless to form; it's all there, in a bundle. So you concentrate, or think of some Deity, or some point for Nirankar, for the formless, or the Nirankar itself. It's all a mental projection as long as you are not a realised soul. But, once you are realised, you have just to think of Dhyana, whom you are going to concentrate, or you can say meditate, on. But once you start meditating on a person your attention starts moving, that is also possible after realisation though, it is in a bundle; but some people have it, part of it, part of it like that.",

Dhyana is there but not Dharana. The second part of it is very important, that you have to put your attention continuously on your Deity. Then you develop a state which is called Dharana in which your attention becomes one with the Deity. But when these mature, the third stage, Samadhi, comes in.",

When that state comes into your mind, then whatever you do, the Deity that you worship, you see that Deity in you work; whatever you see, you see the Deity giving you the show; you can put it like that. Whatever you hear you find the Deity telling you the truth; whatever you read you find there what the Deity would tell you. So, in that state, whatever you do with your eyes, nose and all these organs, all that becomes a kind of manifestation of the Deity whom you worship, automatically. You don't have to think, 'now I must concentrate, all right, I will not have these thoughts, I have now to think about this.' It becomes automatically there; you read a book, in that book immediately you find what is good for Sahaja Yoga. If there is a book which is anti-God, you discard it.",

The nature itself works out for the birth of the child. In the same way, when this Ritambhara Pragnya starts expressing itself, only for Sahaja Yoga, nobody else, you are amazed how things work out suddenly. So, the Ritambhara Pragnya has started working in your favour. You all tell me: this is a miracle that has happened Mother, and we don't know how it has happened. I'll give you an example, yesterday we were doing something with cement and the Italian boy said that we will need two bags of cement.

It just happens, and people don't know how it happens, but that is what is the state of Samadhi. But there could be people if I tell them, 'Will you do this?', 'Oh no Mother, the shop will be closed.', 'Oh they won't do it, that's not all right'. They go on like that.

Actually what happens that, without rising up to that status, if we also say, all right, we are also watching because we are the Spirit, then we do not achieve that calibre. And with all the blessings, like seven auras of the heart, we have got seven ashrams. We do not understand that we all have to discipline ourselves.

But supposing he is a realised soul, he will say, 'Mother I have got my Agnya chakra catching, please take it away’, because it becomes a reality to him. And when it becomes a reality, you must know you are enlightened. If it is all darkness, you do not see, but when there is light you start seeing what is wrong with you. You start seeing that we are all sitting under one roof. Any problem of this hall is going to cause problem to all of us, and that is how you become collectively conscious within yourself.",

You should be singing and chirping like a bird, you should be laughing and enjoying like a flower. While you find human beings all looking so very unhappy. What’s the reason? The reason is that you are separated from your own being, the being that integrates you; you are completely disintegrated. When you disintegrate a hydrogen atom you form a very big force built into it. In the same way, you are disintegrating your being, your physical being on one side, your mental being on another side, your spiritual being on another side. There’s no integrating part, and when you cannot feel that integration you feel guilt, but that guilt is a symptom of a very big destructive force built-in. This is the way we are going to destroy ourselves. No other way. Our destruction is not going to come to us from outside, that can be controlled; it’s going to come from within ourselves.

We have to encourage them to do God’s work. You have to support them because they are the machines, they are the hands and you are the power. Of course, if these hands go against the power they will suffer. So there should be no competition between children and you – my child, his child, there should be no such competition, take out your mind from there. There should be complete sharing. So the competition should end in sharing. How we share? How much can we share?",

Children talk like that, like a third person. You’ll be amazed, you will see the joke behind the whole thing, you’ll know how to laugh at yourself. 'Oh Mr so and so, come along now, he’s behaving like this.’ And you’ll really become Master of yourself, because you know how to handle this baby. It will give that sense of maturity. So, to say, this is my child, this is my wife – of course you have to look after your wife and your children because they’re your responsibility, but do for other children more than you would like to do for your own child. So this complete identification with your children, over-protectiveness, will give you trouble. You have to believe that your family is the family of your Father, and your Mother is looking after it. If you think you can look after your family by yourself, go ahead. So don’t be overprotective, don’t be too worried, too upset about your family, and keep a very sociable temperament so that your children also don’t become like that – tell them how to share. Many people have a habit to serve your child first – is absolutely very vulgar, shows bad breeding. Must serve others first, then your own family. Keeping something back for your children is a sign of a person who is like a frog, who lives in a small well. Get over it.",

It is the memory which gives you, it is a myth, it is the memory that tells you 'Oh, you are again possessed’.

So he will have to burn his hand to feel that this burns, and touch something cold to know that it is cold. So, into the actual experiencing of it he lives, but that that actual experiencing becomes the memory, and once the memory is built up stronger, the whole personality is affected by memory. All the conditioning of all kinds comes through that. Even the whole atmosphere can come to you, smelling a soap or a rose; you may feel really elated, happy or unhappy, because of memory. This memory might have given you superego, or might have given you ego.

And if you are unhappy, then you should know that there is some sort of suppression on your ego and there is superego developing. So both situations have been of no help to you. Of no help to you for your growth. Both these institutions develop so much that you are away from the real experiencing. The real experiencing stops because your Attention is so muddled up.

Now in Sahaja Yoga people come in with different kinds of attentions or Chitta. There could be people who have too much of Tamsivrati (left sided) and what you call inertia or the more sort of sluggishness or slow movement temperament. These, when they are exaggerated, people take to an addiction, or take to alcohol or some such things, which take you away from reality and make you numb.",

The others are denying everything that is beautiful, and are ego oriented. So we have people who are super ego oriented, very much conditioned and lethargic and lazy and absolutely revolting. The other side people, who are extremely ambitious, dominating and are destroying each other by their competition.

Because in the city people are supposed to be very busy. They think other things are much more important than seeking God and wasting your time in such pursuits like seeking god. Under such circumstances Sahaja Yoga takes its roots, very sweetly into the hearts of all seekers.

This has been happening in Bombay very often. This has been a common thing that is going on, but this is know as Yoga Bhrasta, where a person falls from his Yoga, comes down from his Yoga, because Sahaja Yoga gives you all the freedom, whether to fall or come up. But if you go to any other Guru, doing other sort of yoga in which purification takes place, and where people are trained and disciplined from their childhood, in that yoga the Guru sees that you are somehow or other you are injured or hurt so badly that you have no connections with anybody else; like an operation, they take out that person and throw him out.",

The old age will disappear, their body will remain as it is, and they will have a body which is Divine. What a promise! So don’t worry too much about your bodily comforts. All right, maybe that some of you, if you want, can fly in the air also with that body. Also they can become subtle and enter into the body of others to get them cured. That you are already doing. They will not be touched by the fire and by any weapons. Also you will be able to see these subtle things with your own eyes. You can see them. This will not only happen in India, but all over the world.",

    "Quote": "The value of marriage Sahaja Yoga is first to start your germination, then it grows. In that growth you have to become a wider personality. With a marriage you develop even a better personality. Now why is marriage necessary for Sahaja Yogis? First and foremost it is the most normal thing to do, is to marry. God has give you this desire to be married for some purpose, but this same desire, if you do not use it for the purpose it is given, it can become a perversion, it can become a nasty thing, it can be very detrimental to your growth. So one should understand this desire within us to have a marriage. Marriage means wife who is part and parcel of your being, a wife on whom you can depend. She’s your mother, she’s your sister, she’s your child. She’s everything. You share all your feelings with your wife, so it is important that the wife should be such that she should understand that this is the need of a marriage. Now, in Sahaja Yoga, as you have seen, all of you have problems either of the left or of the right. Now when these marriages will take place, most spontaneously, it will happen, by Nature’s plan itself, that you marry a person who is complementary personality to you, because if you are a left-sided person and you marry a strong left-sided person, it will compensate and make a good marriage.",

If you do not know how to share life it’s going to be very difficult. When it comes to love, how do we express our love? By sharing all our joys, all our pains, all our problems… But in Sahaja Yoga it is a little more, I think quite a lot more, much more. Here you have to share the community. The marriage is not for individuals in Sahaja Yoga, not at all. If anybody has a feeling a marriage in Sahaja Yoga is between two people, is a wrong thing. It is two communities, it can be two nations, it can be completely two universes. So it is not to be enjoyed between yourselves. If you are a good husband and wife to each other, it is not sufficient in Sahaja Yoga. That love should be enjoyed by everyone else in the society, in the community. If you cannot do that then you have not achieved Sahaja Yoga marriage, it is just an ordinary marriage, as people have, just that, nothing special. Sahaja marriages should be able to give chances for very great souls to come on this earth. A person who is married in Sahaja Yoga, who are Sahaja Yogis, who are sharing their love equally with the Sahaja Yogis and the society that is Sahaja Yoga, then only Great People will be born.",

So first test of a Sahaja Yoga marriage is how much have you been able to share, by this marriage, love with other people. Now, for example, in a normal marriage, man is the person who is head of the family, as you say, now, he has to be the head for certain reasons, there is nothing wrong with man becoming the head, it’s all right, you become the heart. Heart is more important than the head. Perhaps we do not realise that, how heart is important, you see, even if the head fails the heart can go on. WE can always go on up till the heart is going on, but if the heart fails, the head fails too. So, you are the heart as the woman and he is the head of the family. Let him have that feeling that he is the head; it is a feeling, just like a feeling. Like the head always feels he decides, but the brain also knows that it is the heart one has to cater for, it is the heart which is all-pervading, is the real source of everything. So the woman’s position, if she understands how important it is, she would never feel let down or dominated, if she knows she is the heart. I think this is the point people, women especially, in the West, have lost and have forgotten and have not realised. If they had realised this point there would have been much less problem.",

Brain is a headache, you know, it works, works like mad, but heart is the one which really covers the body with its love and can soothe, give it joy and happiness. It is the heart which contains the Spirit. So heart is a very important thing, which is the power of the body, like ultimately you have to become the Spirit which is in the heart.",

But the woman should not feel dominated if the man says, 'All right, you don’t work’, but if he says it in love! Now, if the brain starts dominating the heart too much, what will happen? Then there will be dryness, you see, like many men are very meticulous, very particular, they are headaches, absolute headaches to themselves, to others and to the whole society. Such people can become extremely dry, and they can be all the time, you see, like they can never enjoy their wives, they cannot enjoy their children, they cannot enjoy anything whatsoever, because, you see, they are so particular. Like, they say, 'Come at 5.10’, if you reach at 5.9 or 5.11, you have had it. They are just watching time, just to find out the faults. You see, as soon as the wife comes in they’ll be shouting, 'What! You come so late!’ How many? 45 Seconds lost.

The man may become a little funny, but he’ll come round. He’ll go a little astray, but he’ll come round. But do not judge him in outward dominations … like you see if he says, 'this colour is not good’ – 'all right, whatever you like I’ll put it’.

She gets that, what you call a hunch, they get a hunch of it, and that’s what it is. And once they start understanding that the hunches of the wife are correct, then they follow you? It’s wrong I think. There’s no need for him to follow…'You go this way’ … what need is there to do all that? We are going the same way, but we must know somebody is on the left, one is on the right.

When He had to kill Kama, he had to ask Radha to do it. It was She who did everything. She had to dance, and He pressed Her feed and He said; 'Now you must be tired’. Why did She dance? Because without Her dancing the thing could not work out. So it is to be interdependent, as you cannot have only a wick and you cannot have only the light. You cannot have these two things separate.

Every sort of destructive power is used for the construction, as if it is tricked. (Like now, I told them a trick, how to trick these Gurus. The power they have can be tricked against them as it is said that their teeth must be put into their necks, into their throats. Instead of taking out their teeth, better put them back in their throats. And, if you can do that, then there is no problem as far as their effect on us is concerned because you are more powerful and more tricky.)",

First it is attractive by its flowers, by its timber, by the other parts of its body, and people try to destroy it for it. But when the fruits appear, they want to preserve it, and the tree bends down with humility – is very valuable. So you are the fruits, that Viratangana Shakti, you are the fruits because you are so valuable that those people who wanted to ruin or destroy the Divine power from this Earth will start thinking that they have to gain something out of these fruits. So the Virata Shakti has given you a great value because people see that by having one Sahaja Yogi with them it is so precious. Say one ordinary man gets his realisation, then he develops his value. In that, his own value, he can be respected, love and he can be given the highest, if he’s a proper Sahaja Yogi. So you should understand today that Virata Shakti is, we are going to worship that Virata Shakti which has given fruits. As a result of that all these different churches, fanaticism, atheism, communism, and all that -ism will neutralise because they will see their benefit in it. But you have to become that, that is the biggest one has to know, to bend down towards Mother Earth. Be humble, absolutely. The humility inside is going to give you the complete value of Sahaja Yoga Fruits.",

Only the fruits that bend down are accepted as good and matured fruits, and not those who assert that they are the highest. But some of the negative people should not, by any chance, take advantage of this and say that they are good because they are bending down. It’s not the logic. Some of them pose as humble, even a rotten fruit bends down, but the mature fruit shows its humility by its weight. That is the Guru Tattwa weight. So from the Viratangana Power you get the power of maturity, up to the fruit, and then we become blessed by Guru Principle. Those who are still involved in getting to better sunshine, better water supply, or all these things, are not yet matured, because the fruit doesn’t need anything anymore. It doesn’t need anything from Mother Earth nor from the elements, but it surrenders, it bows to the Mother Earth. So the Sahaja Yogi who goes on asking questions to Mother, bring personal problems, stupid ideas, negativity, all those people are still not yet the fruits.",

Madhura – there is no word like it in English language, but it means 'sweet power’. Like the fruit becomes sweet, that’s how you all have to become very sweet. Krishna tried to make everything very sweet in the sense it was all a Madhura Shakti that was acting, all His play, all His dancing, all His stories, if you read is nothing but Madhura Shakti, towards Gopas and Gopis, towards other Sahaja Yogis. So you have to keep your mother pleased by pleasing other Sahaja Yogis and not other people. They are not important.

You must move your neck with respect and with understanding that Shri Krishna is sitting there, with Dignity.

And if Surya Chakra, at the Agnya level is occupied by Lord Jesus Christ, then it is even more essential that the purity of life, what you call Niti is the morality of life. Now, morality itself has become very much a sort of argument in the West. People don’t have any sense of absolute morality. On vibrations you know, but they have all gone against it because you cannot be a Surya if you don’t have a proper sense of morality and holiness. The Surya itself brings light to see everything clearly. Those who are the worshippers of Lord Jesus, of the Surya, of the Saraswati, have all gone against the powers of Surya, just disobeying it.

Such a person attracts, but not for lust, greed and nonsensical things, but because of the fragrance of love in the subjects. Not is always confused because it is such an abstract thing, so one must understand it in a very subtle way, what is this magnetism. You see, there are some gestures people use artificially, which they have been using just to attract other people: the way they walk, dress, the way they live. All these things are of no use. It is something so inner, that fragrance is so inner which must be developed. But in Sahaja Yoga I have seen people just do not bother about it; they think the way they have been living as English, French, Indian, Kolapur, they will be like that. First these ideas must be curbed off because they fragrance spreads everywhere through, first of all, the Ganesha Principle within.",

It’s not like that, it’s not that. On the contrary, the quality of magnetism is such that it attracts you to a point where you are not disturbed. Now, this is a very important point we should know. You see, if you other loves, love like carnal love and all other love you have, then that love, you may attract another person, then that person can destroy you, and it destroys you always, but this attraction does not destroy, does not destroy. The attraction is up to that point that you are not destroyed because you being much higher, much deeper and much weightier, you cannot be destroyed by a thing that… whom you are attracting. The greater magnet attracts the smaller magnet, and that is what one should understand. The magic and this charisma, charismatic temperament of a person, comes by, first of all, the Ganesha Tattwa, innocence; and secondly by complete dedication and devotion. Those who are completely dedicated and devoted to Mother, not to anything else – Ganesha Tattwa again; not to your wife, husband, sister, country – not to anyone but Mother. Complete dedication gives you that charisma or that attraction. In Sahaja Yoga such a person because really attractive and such a person has it.",

People like you because they can dominate you. Now if you think that by your aggressiveness, shouting and screaming at these people you will achieve that charismatic temperament, you cannot. You cannot achieve that height. So, how do you achieve it? By becoming innocent. Now, how innocence develops in a person is by not thinking about it. Like, you see, somebody asked my 'How do you manage your income tax?’, I said, 'By having no income at all’ Car problem? By not having any car of my own. House problem? By having no house of my own. 'Nihi, Nihi’ - everything Nihi for me. Then how do you, sir, solve this problem? By not having it. Don’t take headaches upon yourself. See, when you take headaches upon yourself, then only the innocence is reduced. Headaches like this: this is my shawl, my sari, my this thing. But only one thing is that: 'this is my Mother and I have to proclaim Her’, that is all. If that is the way, then the innocence starts rising like Shri Ganesha, and by having no other headache.",

Whatever is not 'mine’ is 'I’, so what remains is your Spirit. Somebody gave me this good argument to work it out, then whatever remains is the 'I’, and that is the one we have to see to. So you go on reducing all these 'mines’ so the Pure Spirit of innocence will rise. So the idea about Spirit also, people think that if you become spiritual, I mean, I don’t know what people think about spiritual people, but the idea is that you have something terrific, like a bull, or, I don’t know, you have to be sharp like a fox or an intellectual like Freud or something. All sorts of ideas people have. No, it is not, Spiritual person is just innocent, just innocent. There is no intelligence, nothing, just innocence.

It will act in its own way. So try to develop that innocence which is the basis of Mahalakshmi Tattwa, we should say, or that is the essence of Mahalakshmi Tattwa. So the outward things, the weightage, the weight, the dignity, the behaviour, everything – it is the outward thing and the inside thing – the Tattwa, the Principle, on which it is based is Innocence. Now if it is this, if we understand Mahalakshmi Tattwa within us, how it has to work out – again I would say I don’t want you to project your intellect into it, just remain where you are, and you will find the answers coming to you, automatically – just don’t project your minds into it, just you will get answer to every question just like that.",

The purity, the innocence, is Love, and which is Life itself, we should say, is a part of that, the prized. But Pranashakti (Power of Life Force) is not Mahalakshmi. So Mahalakshmi is the essence, and the essence of everything, because if creation has to take place, also if 'Desire of God’ is there, and if there is no Mahalakshmi Tattwa, then what is the use of having desire?

So this Ganesh Tattwa ultimately overpowers everything and permeates through everything, and this is, I would say that, just don’t think about it, just allow your innocence to grow. Simple innocence and your Dignity, that is very important, you have to have your dignity. Like some people think if they wear tall clothes and walk about on the street and all, they are big Sanyasis. It is wrong. Why? You are not being dignified and God has given you so much why should you try to show off that you have not got anything? Just to show off that you have not got anything God has given. This is just a sort of thanksgiving to God; you have given me so much you have to wear the best. Like in puja, if you see the ladies here, ear all their nose-rings and all their ornaments and everything, in the temple they wear, and in the same way men also wear their very clean dresses, whatever they have, but no ostentation.

The preciousness of your Spirit is immeasurable and that is why it is called the thing of eternal value, because it is infinite. We cannot measure. Now, God the Almighty we say is Sat-Chit-Anand. Sat means Truth. The truth we understand in human terminology is relative, but the Truth I am telling you is absolute, from where all the relations start. Example I will tell you how to understand: this earth has got oceans and rivers and all kinds of waters you say, but the earth is enveloping all of them. If the Mother Earth was not there, there could not have been any of these existing. So we can say that the Mother Earth is the support of all the things that exist on earth. She is enveloping us. In the atoms she exists, because the elements are part of that earth. In the same way is God Almighty. The Sat part of Him, the Truth is the support of all the things that are created or not created. Another example: you try to understand how the Sat is the Purush, is the God who does not take part, actual part, in the creation itself but is a catalyst. The example can be like this, that I am doing all the work, I am creating everything, but I have a light in my hand. Without the light I cannot do anything. Light is the support of my work, but the light does not in any way do anything about what I do. In the same way, God Almighty is just the witness, like a light.",

All these three things, Sat-Chit-Anand, when they are at zero point, where they meet, then they become the Principle of Brahma.

Is it clearer? You will understand now, Mahalakshmi, Mahakali and Mahasaraswati. That is why Christ has said, 'I am the Light’ because He represents the Sat, the Light of God.

To a dog beauty and decency has no meaning, so at a stage when you reach, when you are a human being to that extent you develop your Sat, which is awareness, your Joy and creative action, now you see how the creativity of God passes into the hands of man when he turns out, how the Joy of God passes into the hands of man, and how His Light comes into the heart of Man as Spirit.",

He was Brahma, He was Mahavishnu, as I have told you about His birth. And He came on this earth in a body, like a human being. He wanted to show another thing, that the Spirit has nothing to do with money, has nothing to do with power. It is all-powerful, all pervading, but He was born in a stable, not in a palace or to a king, but He was born to a very ordinary person, a carpenter. Because, if you are a king, we say in Hindi language Badshah, then nothing is greater, higher, or can decorate you. All the worldly things are just like the dry grass! Tranavat!

Besides man-made bindings such as 'My body should be healthy and beautiful’ are inculcated, then, unreal relationships like, 'He is my father, he is my brother, she is my mother’ are on your head. Many officials and politicians become egoists (donkeys). As ego develops, foolish ideas such as, 'I am rich, I am poor, I am helpless’, or, 'I belong to a high family’, etc come in your head. Then there are anger, hatred, forbearance, separation, sorrow, attachment under the cover of love, and temptations in the guise of social status. Man, with great affection keeps clinging to this unreal way of life. If you think of getting rid of all these, and make efforts, what you get is the illusory knowledge – because the attention (Chitta) moves along Pingala channel, and then you are involved in Siddhis (Powers), and other temptations. A vision of Kundalini and Chakras is also illusory because there is no gain from it, on the contrary, it is harmful.

This Chitta must become one with that Atman. Only that Chitta which progresses, renouncing all unreal (Mithya), breaks all known and unknown bindings and becomes verily the self. Atma is never disturbed or destroyed. Only human attention (Chitta), in pursuit of desires, leaves its inner path. This is Maya (illusion). She has been intentionally created. Without her the attention (Chitta) would not have developed. You should be afraid of Maya and should recognise here so that she will illuminate your path. Cloud hides the sun, as also makes it seen. In the same way, once Maya is identified, she moves aside and the sun is seen. The sun is always there, but what is the purpose of the cloud?

When the second one explodes, it gives an acceleration many more times than that with which it was already moving, the speed increases in such a tremendous way that suddenly we find that the acceleration is a very high multiple of the first one. Then the third one, when it explodes, gives another push to the capsule. Next, the fourth one explodes, then the fifth one which contains the spacecraft. Through this kind of explosions from one to the other, through that built-in mechanism, we have been able to achieve a very high acceleration for the spacecraft. In the same way our evolution has taken place. We got this idea without even knowing about our evolution, from the unconscious. We have come to know how it has happened, but we cannot correlate both these together. In the same way, a human being was created out of the elements.",

We have to transform it into a form; we can say into an entity, which we call in the Bible, the Holy Ghost and in the Sanskrit language, the Adi Shakti.

And there should be no doubts about it because they are not worth it. But still, if you have any doubts, I will like to attend to them, definitely. More over sometimes we get good questions and give me idea of as to what is the problem. So that will also be welcome. But do not sit down with the attitude of doubting Toms. Sahaja Yoga is a very big subject, and it is rather difficult to explain the whole of it. It is by which you get your physical, mental, emotional and spiritual integration, because all the centres come into play, and brings enlightenment onto all the four aspects of your life; into the totality, so that you feel your wholesomeness in collective consciousness. It is quite complicated sentence I have said in short, but if you have any problem about it, you can ask Me without any fear. I am your Mother, May God Bless you.",

Now they were all there so now we are going to thank them, that you have been here and the marriage has been successful.

The ascended Kundalini establishes a direct link with the unconscious. It manifests as the flow of vibrations. 3. The Deities on the chakras are awakened. They are the reflection of the original Deities on the Adi chakras of the Virata, and they 'organise’ our awareness accordingly. As they are linked together by the ascended Kundalini, the personality becomes integrated. They decode and respond to messages from the Holy Spirit. They read other human beings as awareness systems. They direct our spiritual growth. 4. Collective consciousness is achieved. The attention is drawn inside because of the inward happening of the Kundalini’s rise. 5. In a fully mature realised being, the Deities ascend, from their place of work in the chakra, to their own seats within the Sahastrara. This is the stage of complete Divine integration.",

One has always to try to find out sweet words. Now the birds are chirping. In the same way you have to learn all the sounds of everything by which you make people happy by your sweetness.

Faith word was never clarified in any one of these books, and mostly people thought blind faith is the only way to believe – is to have blind faith. It should have been clarified, but it was kept a great term as 'faith’. So the people started working it out. For example, you are walking on the road thinking of God; suddenly I found a gold ring, so my faith was substantiated, that it was God who has helped me to get the ring. Or, say there was divorce and I prayed to God and the divorce did not take place – it is God’s help. But this kind of praying can have another side. People can that that the people who do not believe in God at all are quite successful. Then how do you explain that? They have no faith, they are actually heathens, they are very successful in life.

So, from balancing and integration, we go to the third point, is discretion, because you are very senior members of Sahaja Yoga, very senior students, it’s easy to criticise others, say they are wrong, but it should be easiest to see what is wrong with you, because you cannot correct others, you can only correct yourself.

You have to be absolutely frank – open – with each other. Absolutely. Tell them your problems. 'I catch on this, what should I do? How to clear it out?’ Not to feel shy. We have to enjoy ourselves. Also enjoy our weaknesses, so that we clear them out. Laugh it out. That’s the best way to do it. The difference between a human being and a Sahaja Yogi is the same as a human being and a drunk fellow. This is the difference, so what is the use of arguing with them and getting angry, getting into tension. I mean, they are drunk.

First we have to day, when we sit for meditation, that, 'I am going to be worthy of your appreciated. Make me humble so that I am appreciated by You and My only desire is to please You.’ Then you sit down, in complete preparedness, meditating over your Mooladhara, putting your attention to it with absolute purity. Now, you have My photograph before you and you tell the photograph, 'Mother, You are Sri Ganesha. You give me wisdom and discretion.’ So, attention is at the Mooladhara chakra, which is actually below the sacrum bone. You put your right hand towards the photograph and your left hand on Mother earth. Now this will tell you that your mind, or your brain, which is full of confusion, has not discretion, is complicated, which does the same mistakes again and again, which does not understand how to cure the ills of bad feelings, all that can be cured if you put your Right had towards Me, and the Left hand to Mother earth.

The behaviour should be such that there should be no expression of ego in your behaviour. Your Mother is a good example. I think you know that I know quite a lot of things, but I never show off, nor ever assert that I am so knowledgeable, I live like a very, very ordinary person with you, and I do not in any way assert My personality that gives you a shock. So with your intelligence, or with your other powers – like if you are a moneyed man, or more efficient or anything – you should not try to impress on others, but you must deal with it beautifully. So the beauty comes when you are efficient and you are loving. That is the central point, that is the result, that you are knowledgeable and you are humble. That you know everything about everyone, but you are discreet. Only a complete personality can give that very soothing effect. So the soothing effect comes as a result of beauty.

You have to be Prasanna-chitta, which means you should be a very happy, joyous personality, and not a tense, abrupt person.

But many people confuse innocence with stupidity, they think to be stupid is to be innocent, and a stupid man gets an ego trip in no time. Innocence is the wisest thing. You cannot befool innocence, that’s the main thing. No one can befool Me, I am very innocent. Innocence is that which does not harm anyone, that does not think that it can solve problems but it leaves everything for God to solve.

The source of emotional security. He’s like a child, a very charming, beautiful child, and people feel extremely … enchanted. A motherly enchantment, because charming also is a very funny word. Because, in the west, people don’t understand even innocence towards children. So you have to be childlike, not childish. Confusion must not be there. But some people confuse it, they think it should be like a big baby, you see; and that you have to be treated like a big baby all the time, from bottle feeding to nappy changing – in Marathi it is called Motha Bal, and there’s no end to it. So this kind of thing, if it is done to someone, they really will become a stupid fellow in no time. But Ganesha’s enchantment has dignity. He may look like a child, but He is an old man.

Certainly in India there have been lots of mistakes like that: now I give you one example of Mr X, who is a great Sahaja Yogi in the sense that he is a great organiser, he has done this, he has done that, and we start adoring him. Or we may be jealous, one of two things happen, wither we adore or we are jealous. No, if you adore that person, then you should follow in his footsteps. And if you are jealous then it is more reason to follow his footsteps so you become more like him.

Because you see a person is normal, you feel jealous of such a person, then you feel you are jealous, so you have every right to do what you like. You just say, 'I am jealous of you, because you are so good, so now I can be very bad.’ But now the bad thing is taken as blackmail, you use it for blackmailing others, that, 'Oh alright, I am a bad man. So? I am a bad man, you are a good man, alright, so what?’ Just like that, to use it as a power. Like yesterday, one madman came, a lunatic, now when this lunatic came, he wanted to sit at the front, and he just started taking advantage of his lunacy.

So, in Shakto-Upaya, what normally people do is Shakti-Pat, is to make their power, i.e. Shakti, to fall upon another one, like the reflection or, as we say, the light is falling upon us.

    "Quote": "So this Agnya Chakra is the gate, is the door of Heaven, and everyone has to pass through it. Now, on this Chakra resides the great incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ. In our Indian Shastras, He is called as Mahavishnu, the son of Radha Ji, and His essences are made of eleven Rudras, means 11 destroying powers. But the governing essence, the main essence, is that of Shri Ganesha, means innocence. So He is the embodiment of innocence. Innocence means complete purity And His body was not made out of Mother Earth in the sense that, He never had a body that was perishable. It is Aumkara. So when He died, He ascended. That is the fact. He ascended. Now, as He is the Son of Radhaji, you can see the relationship between Him and the other Deities very easily. About Mahavishnu it is written in the Devi Bhagvat (but nobody has time to read it). To understand Jesus Christ you must read the Devi Bhagvat, but if you say this to Christians, they would not like to listen to you because for them, Bible is the last word. How can it be? Because Christ’s life is depicted there only for four years. We have to open our eyes to other books, and see for ourselves what is truth.",

You have to take His name – proves it was Christ who was ruling. To awaken Jesus Christ, if you do not awaken Him, it would not open. Or even if you take the name of Mahavishnu, it opens. So Mahavishnu and Jesus Christ are the same. So you must see the proof of it and just because you want to believe that Christ is your own and discard everyone else as heathens, absolutely you are sadly mistaken. In every scripture people have entered from the back door, every scripture. I told you about Gita, what wrong things they have written about the food which is scientifically not true. To say that Tamogunas are the people who eat meat is not true because they eat protein, and they have to be Rajogunis automatically. So, how they have tried to change it, just to suit their thing at that part. But in the beginning, they could not, because they said, Krishna said that, 'You kill these people!

There is no way you will see they will oppose each other, never. So this point is to be proved also, and that can only be proved if you know how to raise the Kundalini. If you are a realised soul and if you can raise the Kundalini, you will be amazed to see that all these Deities are placed on various chakras and they are to be raised. Now sometimes, you see, I am blamed in India, that I am preaching about Christ, so I am spreading Christianity; and if I go to England, they say I am preaching about Krishna, so I am spreading Hinduism.

And you can see that above the Vishuddhi Chakra stands Mahavishnu, and He is the gate through which everybody has to pass. He actually Blessed Him special. See now that you have known that Shri Ganesha stays at Mooladhara Chakra, means the support of the roots, but Christ is placed at the support of the fruit. So the same thing evolves at that point, that you become aware of Christ only when your Agnya Chakra opens. Now, this Agnya Chakra can be opened when the Kundalini goes up and opens it up, but supposing, if you are too much ego oriented, then you have turned it so tight, say, two ropes have turned it so tight that nothing can pass through, or, if you are too much of a superego and a frightened personality and a dominated one, then also it is twisted so badly that Agnya Chakra cannot open up, so, what we have to do is to give a balance through the Agnya Chakra by moving left to right, or right to left, according to the need, which you will understand in the technique of Sahaja Yoga after realisation.

Shri Ganesha, He is the one who removes all the hurdles of life and you, really, when Blessed, you can see that God has so many ways of Blessing the people. It is miraculous, absolutely, it is a miracle. So many people who are in Sahaja Yoga now say that miracle has lost its meaning in Sahaja Yoga. It’s a fact. So one has to understand that God exists. Not only He exists, He acts, He Loves, and that we are supposed to know Him. Whatever you may have done, whatever the mistakes, you have to become One with God, because He is your loving Father. He is the Father who is the Ocean of Love. The only thing you have to do is to ask for it, and when the Kundalini you become One with Him, and He wants to bestow all His Kingdom, all His Powers upon His children, whom He has created. So all these funny ideas about religion: that you have to suffer, that you must do penance, that you should become Brahmacharis, all these absurd ideas should be given up.

If they are a realised soul, more so, because if they are not realised souls, then their reaction is not so violent, but if they are a realised soul they scream and should and cannot bear it. So one must understand, though it looks like traditional thing, one must see that those things which are harmful to human beings must be given up.

But how do you open this? Very simple thing is that any thought comes to you, you should say, 'I forgive’. This is the greatest weapon Christ has given us. You just say, 'I forgive. I forgive. I forgive’, and you can overcome your ego. This is the mantra for this chakra in front, it will open out and you will find your ego will go away. Forgiveness is one of the biggest weapons human beings have got. They are stupid and say it is difficult. When you say, 'I forgive’, do you do something? Nothing! On the contrary, when you do not forgive, then what is happening? The person whom you do not forgive is actually torturing you, while you are not torturing that person.

This awareness comes after realisation and if you do not understand that this collective awareness is the only way you can stay in that area, otherwise you get out. You star having your smaller wells and you just go down into them.

Now the fashioning of these subtle ideas is another job, but the beauty of these subtle ideas is that they are Universal in Nature. If they were not, they would not be so appealing to everyone. So there is something universal in these, and that universality, when manifested or fashioned into some expression, then it is absorbed universally. Now it depends on the person how much closer he is to those images, and the Images of his Spirit. If such a person is a realised soul, then the expression is heavenly. The fashioning of his expression is determined by surroundings, atmosphere, traditions in which people have lived.

Then it moves higher, to the left Nabhi, and at the left Nabhi we start becoming crazy about these dead things, for example, the watch, the time. Time is a dead thing; it is not a living thing. It has nothing to do with living thing. Because living force is infinite, it has not time limit or space limit, you cannot count it, the way it moves, the way it works out. Once we understand that it is a living force, which is spontaneous, which is not bothered about our dead ideas, we come out of the dead. We were first stones, then we became amoeba, then we gradually became human beings so our attention is all the time towards the dead. What should we get? What should we have? What are the needs we have of this body, which is going to die? We do not see the needs of the Spirit. By seeing to the needs of the Spirit you can overcome the left side. You start looking after your Spirit, from which you know you get your Vibrations. If your Spirit is happy, you get your Vibrations, if it is not happy you do not get the Vibrations.",

Both the things are just the same, whether you got to the left or right, the subconscious or the supraconscious mind, both the things are just the same. So, not use going to the past, but if you are too much in the past, it is better to think of the future so that you are pushed a little bit to the centre, but it is difficult with you human beings. Now the other problem starts when we start feeling guilty, when the left Vishuddhi catches. Then you start saying, 'I am very miserable, I am very guilty.’ You start cursing yourself. This is another nonsense. Once you start doing that, then what happens, you again become dead, because living force will never condemn, No, it will never. It goes on progressing itself; it sees which side to move. It is not going to aggress anything, it has the wisdom to be in the Centre, that is how to overcome the left side, watch from the Centre. Ultimately, to escape all this, you start blaming yourself all the time and feeling miserable, ending up with your left side into a very miserable state, that is the culmination of all these attachments to the left side. So, ultimately, you start thinking that you are good for nothing, you are useless, you should have done this or that. You have to overcome it.",

    "Quote": "By the Divine. For example, if I know only my head, that is not sufficient. If I know only my neck, that is not sufficient. If I know only my leg, that is not sufficient. But, the more I know about myself the more dynamic I become: The more expansive I become. And all the great, that existed, or all the people who were called as great, are great because they lived in many human beings. I feel that warmth in the atmosphere, as you are feeling because you know they are not foreigners, they are your brothers and sisters. There are so many stories in Puranas like this that… I will not name it, but once two brothers met in a jungle. But they thought that they were enemies and they wanted to fight with each other, and when they came too close they couldn’t hit each other. Then they took out their arrows, the arrows wouldn’t work. They were quite surprised at this and when they asked each other, “Who is your mother?,” they found out, mother was the same. And then they realized that they were not foreigners neither enemies but they were made of the same fiber. What sweetness, what beauty that knowledge has given them, and what security of understanding that everywhere in the whole world we have brothers and sisters who are on their inner being, on their divine, and how we are bound together with that love. When I talk of love, people think that I am trying to make you weak people - because people think those who love are weak. But the most dynamic power in this world is that of love. Is the most aggressive power - is that of love. Even when we suffer, in love, it is out of our strength that we suffer and not out of our weakness.",

And the king of that place took his cocks to that teacher and told him that you please teach them how to fight. After one month, when the king went to take those cocks with him, he was surprised that the cocks where just silent doing nothing. And he told the teacher that, “What have you done to my cocks? They are not at all aggressive. They are not doing anything. How are they going to fight it out? There’s going to be a race. There’s going to be an exhibition of their strength and what are we going to do about it?” He said, “You just take them.” He took those two cocks with him, and put them in the arena where there were other cocks who had come to fight. These two cocks were very nicely standing. All the other cocks started coaxing and torturing. They were just standing and looking at them. All the other cocks were surprised at their behavior and thought that they were very powerful. And they all fled away. The love that I am talking about - the divine love - makes you not only strong but dynamic. It is the greatest luminous power that we can think of. Only when love is surrounded by gross, and is lost in the gross, it looks as if it is weak and under chains. The time it is released, the dynamic power of love can transcend all the evil powers of the world",

    "Quote": "There are so many pitfalls for a Sahaja Yogi, I have seen it. Of course, even the past is over… even the past can be overcome. In the present also they have many shadows of the past working. For example, when you are sitting in a group, you are involved with each other. Those who are involved with each other, by any relationship whatsoever, must know that this kind of involvement is not going to help them to attain their individual ascent. Everybody is ascending individually though you are collectively contacted with each other and in communication – but the ascendance is individual, absolutely individual. So whether he is your son, brother, sister, wife, friend, you must remember that you are not responsible for their ascendance. You cannot help them for their ascendance. Only Mother’s Grace and their own desire, their own effort to give up all that is three dimensional, will help them. So whenever a thought comes like that, you must know that you have not attained the thoughtless awareness in its full extent. And that’s how you have problems, which are three-dimensional. Sometimes, a Sahaja Yogi will find, a emotion will come into his mind – it will be a emotion of dejection or frustration – and he will be disgusted with himself or with others. Both things are just the same. I have seen some Sahaja Yogis get very disgusted with others. There should be no disgust that is lasting. Of course for a short time you might feel a disgust, it’s all right – it’s a passing phase. Or you might feel disgusted with yourself – may be a passing phase. But if you go on hankering on to it, or if you go on clinging to it, that means you are conditioning yourself; that means you are not in thoughtless awareness. That means that you are in your past.

If you are on the eternal principle, all that is not eternal changes and drops out, dissolves and becomes nonexistent. We have to understand our own dignity, our own essence. The first and foremost is that all the Sahaja Yogis are the chosen ones. They are the people whom God has chosen. In this city of Delhi there are thousands and thousands of people. All over the world there are so many people that we are suffering from overpopulation, but in Sahaja Yoga there are very very few people. And when you are chosen the first, you must also realize that you are the foundations. You are the stones that are to be laid down and have to be strong, have to be forbearing. And that’s why it is necessary that all of you who are now few, who are the first lamps that are going to enlighten other lamps in the world, you have to enjoy the strength of eternity, the strength of Divine Love, the strength of this universal being that you are.

Now if the Kundalini has been stopped by a certain Chakra, which is not working, you shouldn’t get frustrated about it. Supposing your instrument or your car has stopped on the way, what’s the use of getting frustrated with it? You have to learn the mechanism; you have to be a good technician and then you can manage it very well. So all the techniques of Sahaja Yog must be learned and mastered. This you can only do by giving it to others and learning from correcting them and correcting yourself. There is nothing to be frustrated – that’s the worst thing. If you get frustrated and unhappy with yourself, then there is going to be a problem. You have to laugh at yourself and laugh at your mechanism that is out of gear.

That discrimination is spontaneous, it is there, you have got it – self-actualization. You can feel yourself. You know you are not that. You have started talking about your Chakras in the same manner.

You start feeling what is, what are the centers on the other person, what are not working. And these centers as I explained to you yesterday have all the physical, mental and emotional sides which they control and you can make out what’s wrong with the person. You can cure them also by giving them these vibrations. So, through this computer now you get information, you give information and also you can correct, you can execute also information.",

    "Quote": "All people want to listen to lectures. Aren’t you fed up of them? Why don’t you have it? This is the blessing of God. You have to jump into the Kingdom of God and you just see how you’re protected, how you are looked after. There are seven chakras and all the seven blessings are bestowed upon you with a stroke. We have here people who have been nothing in life, after Sahaja Yoga - even this one I will give you as a, as a little chocolate over the castor oil, like they say, that they’re also very much improved materially because it is Lakshmi who is sitting in the Nabhi. This may appeal to many in India, that Lakshmi is cured and you improve even materially. People get promotions, they become this, that. One example is our Dr. Nagensi. He got his Realization and see where he has got. Many people like that. He is a Sahaja Yogi. So many people are Sahaja Yogis who have achieved things in life, but they are busy people, some of them are. But if you could devote a little time for sadhana, and if you come here and see for yourself and give more, then you get more.",

    "Quote": "Because why should God give you all the time vibrations when you are not going to use them? There’s a gentleman is sitting here, his son was suffering from too much of drugs. He was a young schoolboy and he was being cheated and poor boy has been tried. He has spent twenty thousand rupees just curing him. People were just giving him drugs to sleep and drugs to sleep, only tranquillizers. And in one day he’s cured and today he’s sleeping nicely without anything. He had brought and showed Me a prescription which he says … (Conversation in Hindi) Four hundred rupees poor man has to shell out. And for what? Not for curing! To make that boy sleep off. I mean that’s also a kind of a drug and that boy is so normal today. But there will be some satanic here who can create problem for you. So, you decide for yourself.",

    "Quote": "So, the knowledge that we have we do not have a proper method of discrimination. We do not know what is absolute knowledge, which is not. For that you must have vibrations. With vibrations now you can ask all those who has realized you can ask, “Is there God or not?” See the answer you’ll get. (Hindi). All answers come and you can record it on your hands even to a small thing. You must hear Pharkay today he was telling Me about this, that when he, some gentleman was somewhere and he said that “You just find his vibrations.” So he put his hands there and he said, “Let me see the vibrations,” and nothing was coming and nothing you could feel and nothing of the chakras. So he then said, “He cannot be there because I cannot feel anything. So, this man thought of him, “Oh, yes, yes. He must be on the aeroplane, he’s not.” To such an extent it goes!",
